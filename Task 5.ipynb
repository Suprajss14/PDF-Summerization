      "operations management entails the provision for and the control of activities of the production and delivery of goods and services to the final consumer . the general forces of competitive environments and the need for increased productivity and profitability have been dictating developments in the department of operations . principles of operations management have been developed to aid operations managers in improving the efficiencies of their processes .\n",
      "operations management is charged with specific duties in an organization that relates to the production of goods and services . the objectives of operations management can be classified into two categories, “customer service and resource utilization” (Kumar 12) the performance of operations activities with respect to levels of efficiencies pays a key role in balancing the two concepts, customer satisfaction and costs in resources .\n",
      "operations management in the oil and gas industry derives a lot of benefits to an organization through the application of the functions of operation managers . a commendable performance will blend the conflicting objectives of customer satisfaction and resource control to drive an organization into improved productivity and profitability levels . operations performance is also determined by the speed at which operations can be undertaken .\n"
